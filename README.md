# 2DTea
Crappy JavaScript game engine I made because why not.
Work-In-Progress that I'll update on occasion.

NOTE: You probably don't want to use this because it's poorly optimized though.

2DTea was made to be a simple, easy-to-use, 2D game engine.
I mostly made it for myself when I first started to wane myself off of ROBLOX because I was getting tired of the platform.

Anyways, I don't really have any good documentation on the API since it's made mostly for myself, but you can look around if you like.
