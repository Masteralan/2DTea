# 2DTea
Crappy JavaScript game engine I made because why not.
Work-In-Progress that I'll update on occasion.

NOTE: You probably don't want to use this because it's poorly optimized and broken. My current plan is to first fix the physics engine, then switch everything to classes.

2DTea was made to be a simple, easy-to-use, 2D game engine.
I mostly made it for myself when I first started to wane myself off of ROBLOX because I was getting tired of the platform.

Anyways, I don't really have any good documentation on the API since it's made mostly for myself, but you can look around if you like.
Here is a page that quickly reviews the basics of the engine though: https://github.com/Masteralan/2DTea/wiki/The-Basics
